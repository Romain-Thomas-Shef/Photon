VcatPy is a GUi created to make simple 1D plot in python. It uses mainly matplotlib and PyQt5 and it has been build in the spirit of begin fully customizable. You can change fontstyle, fontsize, fontcolors, linewidth of the axes, thickness, etc. Once a customization is created, you can save it into a configuration file and reload it later when you open VcatPy again. The main tool is a graphical user interface and it is started using a command line interface.
