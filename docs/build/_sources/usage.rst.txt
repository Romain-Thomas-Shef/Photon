Using VcatPy
------------
------------


**The help**

You start VcatPy from a terminal. The program comes with a help that you can display in your terminal using the help command.
Use it like this::


           [user@machine]$ VcatPy - -help

This command will display the help of the program:


.. code-block:: shell
     :linenos:

	VCatPy V0.1, R. Thomas, 2018, ESO, This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; 
	and is distributed under the GPLv3.0 Licence terms.See the version of this Licence 
	distributed along this code for details.

	positional arguments:
	file                  Your catalog of data to visualize, this is mandatory
    		              (positionnal argument)

	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit	
	  -t, --header          To be used If a header is present in the catalog (#A B
    			            C D....), you just write '-t'. If you do not use it,
    			            each column will be renames colX where X is the number
    			            of the column (starting at 1).
	  -c CONF, --conf CONF  Properties configuration file. If none is givenm the
    			            default configuration will be loaded

In details it means:

* VcatPy must come with a file as first argument. This file is mandatory. If you do not give it VcatPy will complain (you can see below for the format of the file you can provide VcatPy with).
* Two other OPTIONALS arguments can be used:

	* -t: if each column of your file as a header (e.g. a string at the top with the name of the column) you can ask VcatPy to read it using this argument. If you do not use it, the name of the columns will be col1, col2, ....coli...,colN.
	* -c +configuration file: If you saved a customization configuration previously you can load it using this argument and giving the cuztomization configuration.


Input file format
-----------------

For the current version VcatPy accept only *ascii* catalogs of columns. Some precisions:

* The catalog must contain at least 2 columns and 2 lines.
* Each line must contain the same number of column.
* If your catalog starts with a header the header must start with a hash '#' and each column must be named.
